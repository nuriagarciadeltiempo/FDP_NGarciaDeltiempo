# Final Degree Project

During my Final Degree Project I had to create many small pieces of code to filter and merge relevant information from the data obtained from different databases such as OMIM, ClinVar, Genome Project etc...
In this GitHub are included the scripts I created and used also with the resulting outputs.

Furthermore it contains the main pieces of code that I have been modifying in order to optimize and standarize the TAPES algorithm.
